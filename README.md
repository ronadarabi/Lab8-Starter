Graceful degradation represents the process of thinking and building downwards from interactions implemented in Javascript. Graceful degradation is related to service workers because service workers are standalone and are not apparent to your code outside of browser functionality. This means service workers can be implemented first in Javascript, and then styling and structure can be added, which is the principle of graceful degradation.
